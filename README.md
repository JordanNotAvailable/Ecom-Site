# **Ecom Site**


## **Description**

This is a demo Ecommerce site being used to display my skills in front and backend. This will have a log in, sign up and log out feature, a database to hold information on the created user including : email, name, password and previous shopping. You will be able to access the items without being logged in but to add things to your cart and to "purchase" you'll need to be logged in.
